Network-Attack-Datasets
Datasets of CIC-IDS2017

Info
Network attack datasets for machine learning are fairly not easy to come by, for my practicum 2 I used CIC-IDS2017 Dataset and more of this can be found in the original Dataset folder http://205.174.165.80/CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017/Dataset/CIC-IDS-2017/


The CIC-IDS2017 dataset is entirely generated from a lab environment.
